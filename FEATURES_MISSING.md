# Authflow - Missing Features & Gaps

## üéØ Overview
This document lists features that are **NOT yet implemented** but are required to fully compete with Auth0.

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Have to Launch)

### 1. ‚ùå Client SDKs
**Status:** Planned but not built
**Blocking:** Customer integration

**Missing:**
- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript SDK (`@authflow/js-sdk`)
- [ ] Python SDK (`authflow-python`)
- [ ] Go SDK (`authflow-go`)
- [ ] PHP SDK (`authflow-php`)
- [ ] Ruby SDK (`authflow-ruby`)
- [ ] Java/.NET SDKs

**Why Critical:**
Companies can't easily integrate without SDKs. Auth0's biggest advantage is drop-in SDKs. Without these, companies must manually call REST APIs (huge friction).

**Impact:** üö´ **Cannot sell product without this**

---

### 2. ‚ùå Auth0 Migration Tool
**Status:** Not implemented
**Blocking:** Customer acquisition

**Missing:**
- [ ] Bulk user import API (CSV/JSON)
- [ ] Password hash migration support
- [ ] Auth0 export file parser
- [ ] User metadata migration
- [ ] Zero-downtime migration guide
- [ ] Tenant configuration migration

**Why Critical:**
Companies won't switch from Auth0 if they have to force all users to reset passwords. Need seamless migration.

**Impact:** üö´ **Cannot acquire Auth0 customers without this**

---

### 3. ‚ùå Rate Limiting ENFORCEMENT
**Status:** Database table exists, but NOT enforced
**Blocking:** Production security

**Missing:**
- [ ] Middleware to check rate_limits table
- [ ] Block after X failed attempts
- [ ] Exponential backoff implementation
- [ ] IP-based rate limiting
- [ ] Email-based rate limiting
- [ ] Configurable thresholds per tenant

**Why Critical:**
Currently vulnerable to brute force attacks. Anyone can make unlimited login attempts.

**Impact:** üö® **SECURITY VULNERABILITY**

---

### 4. ‚ùå Universal Login (Hosted Auth Pages)
**Status:** Not implemented
**Blocking:** Easy integration

**Missing:**
- [ ] Pre-built login page (hosted by us)
- [ ] Pre-built registration page
- [ ] Pre-built password reset flow
- [ ] MFA challenge pages
- [ ] Customizable templates
- [ ] White-label branding on pages
- [ ] Social login buttons (Google, GitHub, etc.)

**Auth0 Has:** Fully hosted, customizable login pages - zero code needed
**We Have:** Only backend APIs - companies must build their own UI

**Why Critical:**
Auth0's killer feature. Companies want "just add redirect, we handle the rest."

**Impact:** üö´ **Major competitive disadvantage**

---

### 5. ‚ùå Email/SMS Service Integration
**Status:** Console logs only (development)
**Blocking:** Production emails

**Missing:**
- [ ] Resend integration
- [ ] SendGrid integration
- [ ] AWS SES integration
- [ ] Twilio SMS integration
- [ ] AWS SNS SMS integration
- [ ] Email template management UI
- [ ] Delivery tracking dashboard
- [ ] Bounce/complaint handling

**Why Critical:**
Cannot send real emails in production. All emails currently just log to console.

**Impact:** üö´ **Cannot run in production**

---

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Competitive Disadvantage)

### 6. ‚ùå Social Login Providers (Beyond Google/GitHub)
**Status:** Google/GitHub planned but not implemented
**Gap:** Auth0 has 30+ providers

**Missing:**
- [ ] Google OAuth (callbacks not implemented)
- [ ] GitHub OAuth (callbacks not implemented)
- [ ] Facebook Login
- [ ] Apple Sign In
- [ ] Microsoft/Azure AD
- [ ] LinkedIn
- [ ] Twitter/X
- [ ] Discord
- [ ] Slack
- [ ] Auth0 has: 30+ providers ready

**Why Important:**
Many B2C apps need social login. Auth0 offers dozens out-of-the-box.

**Impact:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Lost B2C market**

---

### 7. ‚ùå Actions/Hooks System
**Status:** Webhooks exist, but not in-flow actions
**Gap:** Auth0's most powerful feature

**Missing:**
- [ ] Pre-login actions (modify claims)
- [ ] Post-login actions (custom logic)
- [ ] Pre-registration actions (block signups)
- [ ] Post-registration actions (onboarding)
- [ ] Password reset actions
- [ ] Runtime code execution
- [ ] npm package support in actions

**Auth0 Actions Example:**
```javascript
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  // Add custom claims to token
  api.accessToken.setCustomClaim('role', 'admin');
  
  // Block login conditionally
  if (event.user.email.includes('spam')) {
    api.access.deny('Suspicious account');
  }
  
  // Call external API
  const fraud = await checkFraudScore(event.user);
  if (fraud.score > 80) api.access.deny('High risk');
};
```

**Why Important:**
Companies need custom auth logic without modifying our code. Auth0 built billion-dollar business on this feature.

**Impact:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Lost enterprise market**

---

### 8. ‚ùå Brute Force / Attack Protection
**Status:** Security events tracked, no active blocking
**Gap:** Auth0 blocks automatically

**Missing:**
- [ ] Automatic IP blocking after failures
- [ ] Suspicious login pattern detection
- [ ] Anomaly detection (time/location)
- [ ] Bot detection / CAPTCHA integration
- [ ] Adaptive security (increase MFA on suspicious)
- [ ] Temporary account lockout
- [ ] Admin alerts on attacks

**Auth0 Has:**
- Automatic IP blocking
- Breached password detection (we have this ‚úÖ)
- Bot detection
- Attack response actions

**Why Important:**
Security is table stakes. Auth0 actively protects without configuration.

**Impact:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security gap for customers**

---

### 9. ‚ùå Complete Documentation
**Status:** README only
**Gap:** Auth0 has extensive docs

**Missing:**
- [ ] API reference documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

- [ ] Video tutorials
- [ ] Code examples repository
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Security best practices guide

**Auth0 Has:** 1000+ pages of documentation

**Why Important:**

**Impact:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocks developer adoption**

---

## üü¢ IMPORTANT (Enterprise Features)

- **Users:** Acme employees (end users)

**Auth0 Has:** Full organization support for B2B SaaS

**Why Important:**
B2B SaaS companies need this hierarchy. Can't serve Slack/Notion/Linear without it.

**Impact:** üè¢ **Cannot serve B2B SaaS market**

---

### 12. ‚ùå Monitoring & Observability
